IOS APP FLEEK

A group project taken on by me and my friend, where we redesign an even planner, and with cooperation from local recreation center.

the desktop application is made using C#, which encorporates google maps, and sends the required parameter to a cloud service(SQL database). Next, the IOS application will connect to the database and fetch the data and display them.

In addition, events can be created on the IOS app as well and send the data to cloud database.
